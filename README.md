# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
The purpose of this application was to create an aesthetically pleasing and informative day planner that a user could save their daily appointments to that would maintain even if the page was refreshed. 


## Installation
This application does not require installation, and can be simply used when navigating to the URL.

## Usage
To use the application, all the user needs to do is to click the input fields, and type in their agenda for the day according to what time that appointment takes place. Once they have done that, they just
need to click the floppy disk image on the right of the time block that the appointment is written in 
and that will save the appointment. They will not be able to enter appointments in time blocks that have already passed. 

## Credits
I developed this project with collaborative assistance from a fellow cohort member, Laurel Thorburn.

## Features
Other than the main input feature that this application employs, the informative feature of it is
the color component. It is designed to show past hour blocks as gray, the current hour block as red, 
and the future hour blocks as green.
